# Quick Start Guide - MedsBuddy

## Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Step 2: Open in Browser
Go to: http://localhost:5000

## Step 3: Create Account
1. Click "Create Account" 
2. Fill in the form
3. Click "Sign Up"

## Step 4: View Database (Optional)
```bash
node db-query.js
```

## That's it! The app is now running.

### Common Issues:
- If port 5000 is busy: `lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9`
- If dependencies missing: `npm install`
- If database errors: `rm sqlite.db && npm run dev`

### Current Status:
✅ Server starts without errors
✅ Database tables created automatically  
✅ Frontend connects properly
✅ Authentication system working
✅ API endpoints responding correctly

The "User not found" messages you see are normal - they happen when the app checks for a logged-in user but no one is logged in yet. This is expected behavior.
